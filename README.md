# Project Chaos
See it in action here: https://jade-yu.github.io/Project-Chaos/

Named after the Greek mythological figure.

This is a simulation of the solar system. There are a few options you can tweak in the settings, like realistic scaling and speed of the rotations/revolutions, among other things.

I might continue working on this when I get the time to add an information box with facts about each planet in the planet profiles. (or add more celestial bodies, perhaps?)
